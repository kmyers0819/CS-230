Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Successful application developer The Gaming Room is looking to expand by creating a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their hit Android gaming application Draw It or Lose It. CTS will assist in this expansion by analyzing the requirements, evaluating the operating system options, and making recommendations based upon the analysis and evaluation to find the appropriate operating system required for the task at hand.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel like the best section of this document for me was comparing and contrasting the platforms in the evaluation section. It forced me to research and learn the benefits and disadvantages of each and to communicate them in a simple, understandable way.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It really lays out the requirements and constraints for the project. It helps you to understand exactly what the client is asking for and how you should develop it to fit the required platforms.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The UML diagram. I feel like I did an okay job of explaining it, but I could have included more detail for someone who may be reading it that might not have had previous experience with a UML diagram.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The users needs are practically the requirements of the program. Without considering those needs in the design, you are basicallyn throwing out the requirements. When the client was communicating the expected functionality, I wrote them down and implemented them into the design constraints. The needs/requirements are the foundation on which you base the constraints.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it much like a to do list. Starting with what the client needs/requires and working through the sections based on those.
